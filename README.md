# üß† Review Understanding Pipeline

This repository implements a multi-step NLP pipeline for understanding and structuring customer reviews. The goal is to move from **raw text** to **structured insights** through sentiment analysis, keyphrase extraction, and label standardization.
The entire workflow is carried out using Qwen3 LLM via Ollama, enabling tool call, ensuring structured output at the end.

## üìã Pipeline Overview

The processing pipeline operates in **three main stages**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Sentiment Analysis  
**Goal**: Rate the entire review on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).

#### Theoretical Context:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assigning an overall polarity score to a review.
- Common techniques include zero-shot classification, review embedding, or trained sentiment classifiers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quantitative Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
**Goal**: Extract opinionated phrases like _"slow service"_ or _"great food"_, and identify references to specific entities (e.g., _"ice cream"_, _"burger"_).

#### Theoretical Context:
- **Keyphrase Extraction / Aspect Extraction**: Pulling out meaningful aspects from text.
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Attaching sentiment to specific targets like _"food"_, _"service"_.
- **Opinion Mining**: Identifying subjective expressions.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Capturing references to named items (e.g., dishes, products).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Standardization / Canonicalization  
**Goal**: Map diverse phrasings (e.g., _"the service was slow"_ vs _"slow service"_) to a single standardized label.

#### Theoretical Context:
- **Text Normalization / Canonicalization**: Reducing linguistic variance across extracted phrases.
- **Synonym Resolution / Clustering**: Grouping semantically similar expressions under unified tags.

#### Output:
A **structured JSON** representation of the review, including:
```json
{
  "rating": 4,
  "positive_points": ["delicious food", "friendly staff"],
  "pain_points": ["slow service"],
  "categories": {
    "food": ["delicious food"],
    "service": ["slow service"]
  }
}
```
