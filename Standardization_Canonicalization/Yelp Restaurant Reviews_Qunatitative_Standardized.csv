Outdoor, order at the window and sit on the picnic tables under the festive outdoor lighting to enjoy your soft serve treats. Chocolate and vanilla always available, with a rotating special third flavor (I love mint week!). There are always special tornadoes (think blizzard) to match the flavor of the week. I also recommend the raspberry truffle tornado; raspberry flavored ice cream with magic shell-like dipping chocolate mixed in. If you want a short journey and some awesome ice cream, go to Sidney Dairy Barn! Update: I love Dairy Barn. It should have 5 stars.

Now onto the review: Dessert/Drink (3/5): For the drink, I got a Blueberry Matcha Latte and I got the Matcha Madness (in a cone) for dessert. Let's start with the drink. As someone who absolutely loves matcha, I knew I had to order this. It is different from most matcha drinks I typically see in which this one comes with blueberry puree. The drink was a good size for what the price was; however, the drink isn't that spectacular. The matcha flavor was nice but the blueberry didn't really add any wow factor to the drink. If anything, I felt as if I couldn't ever taste the blueberry so that was rather disappointing. The Matcha Madness ice cream included the following toppings: two pocky sticks and chocolate shavings. I find that the ice cream itself was pretty smooth and had a really good matcha flavor to it. Only downside was that it was really melty within a minute and the ice cream wasn't as pretty/have a nice swirling effect. Atmosphere (5/5): The establishment was really pretty and I absolutely love the vibe. Decor was pretty minimal but any place that has a neon sign and a grass wall is amazing in my eyes haha. The store was also very clean and neat. Seating was pretty limited as there was only 4 - 5 tables. Service (4/5): Service was alright. I didn't find it to special or felt that workers went out of their way. Did notice that a worker was talking to their buddies when people were waiting to order. Overall, just lack of attention to customers; however, the drink and ice cream came out at a good pace. Overall, Rewind offers customers a good mixture of drinks and ice cream selection to satisfy any sweet cravings. The attention to customer could be improved but timing between order and handout was good. Would I come back? If I was in the area then maybe, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go.

I love strawberry matcha drinks and was so used to being able to find them all over the Bay. However, I hadn't really found a good place to grab one in AZ. I ordered the strawberry matcha with boba at 75% sweetness. First off, the boba was great! It had the perfect chewiness and was sweet without being overly sugary. Definitely a plus point here. The drink itself was good though the strawberry was a bit more artificial than I liked. It also was not as rich as I am used to so that was the only tiny critique I had. Overall, this place is cute and the drinks are delicious. Service is friendly as well. I will definitely be back to try other menu items including the ice cream which looked scrumptious! In regards to Covid, it was great to see everyone wearing masks. There is seating outside with spaced tables if you would like to brave the heat and sip your drinks before heading home. Parking is quite easy within the complex so you can attempt to drink your tea in the car instead of melting as well."", 'standardized_pain_points': [], 'standardized_positive_points': ['Friendly and Helpful Staff', 'Good Atmosphere', 'Special Menu Items']}"

They have a simple menu and easy to understand. Ambiance inside was nice and bright. Seating is limited. There is outdoor seating but very limited as well. The staff were great. They explained the menu what the new flavors were and the wait time for everything. They provide samples if needed and the amount of ice cream is a good amount. The shakes are great even the coconut I was great in place of vanilla. It would be good to have more flavors available for the shakes. There are a good amount of choices for the boba.

They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time.","{'pain_point_dishes': ['Matcha Madness soft serve', 'Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade'], 'pain_points': [], 'positive_point_dishes': ['strawberry matcha latte'], 'positive_points': [], 'rating': 3, 'original_review': 'Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try.
