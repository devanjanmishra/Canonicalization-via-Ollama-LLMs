The function\\'s parameters are only rating, pain_points, and positive_points. But the description says it\\'s to extract from a restaurant review. That doesn\\'t make sense because the function doesn\\'t take the review as input. There\\'s an inconsistency here. The function\\'s parameters don\\'t include the review text, so it\\'s impossible to process any review. \\n\\nThis must be an error in the function definition.
